Ice Cream (Wikipedia)
Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from cream and ice, with added flavors and sweeteners.
This mixture is quickly frozen while it is stirred continuously in a mixer, so that large
ice crystals do not form. Some ice cream is made with carrageenan, a gum found in seaweed
so that it is not sticky and easily eatable. Nowadays, ice cream comes with different flavors,
shapes, colours and textures. It has a melting point of 0 °C (32 °F).
